Ques 5:- Explain the difference between justify-items and justify-self using code examples.
Ans 5:-Justify-content is flexbox specific and applied to a flex container. You declare how the
 flex items within that container will be aligned along the main axis.
Justify items is applied to a container and has the below effects:
In block-level layouts, it aligns the items inside their containing block on the inline axis.
For absolutely-positioned elements, it aligns the items inside their containing block on
the inline axis, accounting for the offset values of top, left, bottom, and right.
In table cell layouts, this property is ignored
In flexbox layouts, this property is ignored
In grid layouts, it aligns the items inside their grid areas on the inline axis
Justify self removes the item justifying itself from the default of its container(see above).
